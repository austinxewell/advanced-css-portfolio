            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>Hi there! I am not your average nerd. I am the type of person who is just as estatic spending hours in front of my machine as I am going to the skatepark. I love basicaly anything out doors. Let the sun shine on my skin and fill my heart with warmth. I wouuld call myself an adreniline junkie, but I feel that as I grow older that doesnt reign as true. Don't think that wont stop me from jumping off a clif into a lake, throwing myself down some stairs at the skatepark, or trying the cool new hip invention my 8 year old daughter finds at school. I love music, everything about it. I mostly listen to hardcore/punk, but there isn't anything I wont play on my spotify playlists. I can play many instraments, but I gravitate to the guitar.

                I spent my pre-teens shredding the parks by day and staying up way to late creating the coolest designs for my MySpace profile by night. Thats really where my love for coding and computer sciences took off. You see, I was born in the early 90's, and wasnt that a crazy time to be born, I've seen the populus transition from landlines, to flip phones, to smartphone, to portable PCs. I've watched as we went from a scociety that didnt have technology in the average home to having it become a necessaty. I've had the incredible oppertunity to sit back and watch as computer sciences expand and create. The world we live in is a fast paced enviroment and I believe technology only fuels that fire.
